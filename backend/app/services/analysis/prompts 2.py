Your task is to analyze screen recordings and identify:

4. Inefficiencies in current operations

Focus on practical automation opportunities that would save operator time."""

Your goal is to describe what they're doing in clear, natural language that anyone can understand.

1. What the person is trying to accomplish
2. Which applications they're using and why
3. How data flows between systems
4. Repetitive actions or patterns
