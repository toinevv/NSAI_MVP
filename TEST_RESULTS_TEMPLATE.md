## What I Need Most

### Critical Questions
1. **Does it find ALL your workflows?** Not just email ‚Üí WMS, but everything you do?
2. **Is the raw GPT-4V response showing real analysis?** Check the JSON to verify
3. **Are time estimates realistic?** Within 20% of actual?
4. **Do you trust the ROI numbers?** Would your CFO believe them?
5. **Any workflows it completely missed?** What patterns weren't detected?

### Most Important Feedback
- **Accuracy**: How well does it understand what you actually do?
- **Value**: Does it find real opportunities or just obvious stuff?
- **Trust**: Do you believe the analysis and recommendations?
- **Usability**: Can non-technical users understand the results?

## Example Report (Quick Version)

```
Just tested with 5 min recording of my morning routine.

Did: Email check, WMS order lookup, Excel update, Teams message, back to WMS

Found: System identified 3 of 5 activities. Missed Teams completely. 
Got the Excel ‚Üí WMS pattern right but time estimate was 2x actual.

Raw GPT response shows it's really analyzing - saw detailed breakdown of apps and actions.

Good: Found inefficiency I didn't notice (switching tabs 15 times)
Bad: ROI calc seems high ($50K/year seems unrealistic)
Missing: Didn't detect my keyboard shortcuts

Would use: Yes, but needs to catch communication tools better
Score: 7/10
```
