# üß† Current Analysis Pipeline - Deep Dive

## Executive Summary

Our current analysis system is **jumping straight to Layer 3 (Implementation)** with ROI calculations and automation opportunities, when we should be **perfecting Layer 2 (Translation/Analysis)** first. We need to focus on understanding workflows deeply before calculating business value.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Overview

### Pipeline Flow
```
Recording (2 FPS) ‚Üí Frame Extraction ‚Üí GPT-4V Analysis ‚Üí Result Parsing ‚Üí UI Display
```

### 1. **Frame Extraction** (`frame_extractor.py`)
- Extracts frames from video at configurable intervals
- Uses FFmpeg or similar video processing
- Produces base64 encoded JPEG frames with timestamps

### 2. **GPT-4V Analysis** (`gpt4v_client.py`)
- Sends frames to OpenAI GPT-4V Vision API
- Uses structured JSON response format
- Cost tracking per request (~$0.01-0.03 per image)

### 3. **Prompt System** (`prompts.py`)
- **17 different prompt types** (too many!)
- Mixed focus: original, discovery, natural language
- Jumping between analysis approaches

### 4. **Result Parser** (`result_parser.py`)
- Converts GPT-4V JSON responses to structured format
- Calculates ROI metrics automatically
- Generates automation opportunities

## üéØ Current Prompts Analysis

### **Problem: We have TOO MANY prompt types**

#### Original Prompts (Layer 3 focused)
- `FULL_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` - Forces specific workflow categories
- `EMAIL_WMS_FOCUSED_PROMPT` - Hyper-focused on one pattern
- `QUICK_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` - Simplified but still Layer 3

#### Discovery Prompts (Better, but unfocused)
- `OPEN_DISCOVERY_PROMPT` - "Tell me what you see" (good!)
- `CLUSTERING_DISCOVERY_PROMPT` - Groups similar actions
- `BUSINESS_LOGIC_DISCOVERY` - Understands decision points

#### Natural Language Prompts (Mixed Layer 2/3)
- `NATURAL_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS` - Good analysis, but includes ROI
- `SIMPLE_NATURAL_ANALYSIS` - Better, more focused
- `WORKFLOW_FLOW_GENERATION` - Creates flowcharts

## üîç What GPT-4V Currently Receives

### Input to GPT-4V:
```
System Prompt: "You are an expert workflow analyst..."
User Message: 
  - "Analyze these screenshots..."
  - Frame 1 (base64 JPEG)
  - Frame 2 (base64 JPEG)  
  - Frame 3 (base64 JPEG)
  - ...
```

### Current Response Format Forced:
```json
{
  "workflows_detected": [...],
  "automation_opportunities": [...],  // Layer 3!
  "time_breakdown": {...},            // Layer 3!
  "key_insights": [...],
  "confidence_score": 0.85
}
```

## üö® Layer Analysis Problems

### **We're Doing Layer 3 Before Layer 2**

| Layer | What It Should Be | What We're Actually Doing |
|-------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Layer 1: Observation** | ‚úÖ Screen recording at 2 FPS | ‚úÖ Working well |
| **Layer 2: Translation** | üîç **What happened?** Applications, sequences, data flow | ‚ùå Jumping to automation opportunities |
| **Layer 3: Implementation** | üí∞ ROI, time savings, automation tools | ‚úÖ Doing this too early |

### **Specific Issues:**

1. **Forcing Workflow Categories**: "email_to_wms", "excel_reporting" 
   - Should: Let patterns emerge naturally
   - Reality: Pre-defining what we expect to find

2. **Calculating ROI Too Early**: "$25,000 annual savings"
   - Should: Understand workflow first
   - Reality: Making financial assumptions without solid analysis

3. **Mixed Prompt Goals**: Same prompt asks for understanding AND automation
   - Should: Separate analysis from opportunity identification  
   - Reality: Confusing the model with multiple objectives

## üéØ What Layer 2 Analysis Should Look Like

### **Perfect Layer 2 Output:**
```json
{
  "what_happened": {
    "natural_description": "User opens Gmail, reads order email, copies customer name and order number, switches to WMS system, navigates to new order form, pastes information, fills additional fields, submits order",
    "temporal_sequence": [
      {"timestamp": "0:05", "action": "Opens Gmail", "app": "Gmail"},
      {"timestamp": "0:12", "action": "Reads email from customer", "app": "Gmail"},
      {"timestamp": "0:25", "action": "Selects and copies customer name", "app": "Gmail"},
      {"timestamp": "0:30", "action": "Switches to WMS tab", "app": "WMS_Browser"},
      {"timestamp": "0:35", "action": "Clicks 'New Order' button", "app": "WMS_Browser"},
      {"timestamp": "0:42", "action": "Pastes customer name in field", "app": "WMS_Browser"},
      // ... detailed sequence
    ]
  },
  "applications_observed": {
    "Gmail": {
      "time_spent": 45,
      "actions": ["open", "read", "select_text", "copy"],
      "data_extracted": ["customer_name", "order_number", "delivery_address"]
    },
    "WMS_Browser": {
      "time_spent": 120,
      "actions": ["navigate", "click_button", "paste", "type", "submit"],
      "data_entered": ["customer_name", "order_number", "delivery_address", "priority_level"]
    }
  },
  "data_flow": [
    {
      "source": "Gmail email body",
      "destination": "WMS customer field", 
      "data_type": "customer_name",
      "method": "copy_paste",
      "manual_steps": 3
    }
    // ... other data flows
  ],
  "patterns_observed": [
    "Same data copied from email to WMS form",
    "User manually types information that was already available in email",
    "User switches between applications 4 times during process",
    "Form validation requires re-entering phone number in different format"
  ],
  "analysis_confidence": 0.92,
  "technical_notes": {
    "apps_detected": ["Gmail (web)", "WMS (web_browser)", "Windows_taskbar"],
    "resolution": "1920x1080",
    "frames_analyzed": 15,
    "unclear_actions": ["typing at 1:23 - text not visible"]
  }
}
```

### **NOT This (Current Layer 3 Focus):**
```json
{
  "automation_opportunities": [
    {
      "time_saved_daily_minutes": 30,     // ‚ùå Too early!
      "cost_saved_annually": 15000,       // ‚ùå Too early!
      "specific_recommendation": "Use RPA" // ‚ùå Too early!
    }
  ]
}
```

## üéØ Layer 2 Focus Recommendations

### **1. Simplify to ONE Analysis Prompt**
Replace 17 prompts with 1 focused Layer 2 prompt:

```
"Observe these screenshots and describe what happened:
1. What applications were used and when?
2. What was the exact sequence of actions?
3. What data moved between applications?
4. What patterns do you notice?
5. Where did the user have to manually re-enter information?

Respond with detailed observations only. Do not suggest automations or calculate time savings."
```

### **2. Remove Layer 3 Calculations from Parser**
- Remove ROI calculations (`cost_saved_annually`)
- Remove automation recommendations 
- Remove predefined workflow categories
- Focus on pure observation and pattern detection

### **3. Enhanced Layer 2 Prompting**
```
SYSTEM: "You are observing a computer user's workflow. Describe exactly what you see happening, step by step, without making assumptions about business value or automation potential."

USER: "Watch these screenshots and tell me:
- Which applications were used?
- What was the sequence of actions?
- What information moved between applications?
- What repetitive actions occurred?
- Where did manual data entry happen?

Be specific and factual. Focus on understanding the workflow deeply."
```

## üí° Key Insight

**We've been trying to build a calculator when we need to build a microscope first.**

Layer 2 is about **understanding workflows deeply** so that Layer 3 automation becomes obvious and valuable. Right now we're guessing at business value without truly understanding what's happening.

Let's build the best workflow understanding system in the world, then layer business value on top of that solid foundation.
