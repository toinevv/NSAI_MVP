feat(supabase): native Supabase foundation + multi-tenant RLS + end-to-end data pipeline validation

Auth-First Native Supabase migration and full data pipeline verification.

Highlights (from OVERARCHING_PLAN.md):
- Auth-first foundation: Replaced backend auth with Supabase Auth (JWT with organization context)
- Native Supabase migration: Removed SQLAlchemy and converted all DB access to supabase.client
- RLS policies: Organization-based row-level security on all critical tables
- API conversion: Converted /recordings and /analysis endpoints to native Supabase calls
- Multi-tenant schema: organization_id added to core tables; indexes and constraints in place

Data Pipeline Validation (from DATA_PIPELINE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md):
- Recording → Analysis (GPT-4V) → Results flow validated end-to-end
- Stored raw GPT responses in analysis_results.raw_gpt_response
- Stored parsed structured insights in analysis_results.structured_insights
- Created individual records in automation_opportunities per opportunity
- Frontend Results UI (4 tabs) connected and rendering data (Overview, Natural, Raw JSON, Workflow Chart)
- Verified RLS filters data by organization across all queries

Database Migrations:
- Bulletproof migration (004) completed; complete multi-tenant migration (005) ready
- Added supporting migration scripts and documentation

Docs:
- Added OVERARCHING_PLAN.md and DATA_PIPELINE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md detailing scope and validation

Notes:
- This commit captures the stable localhost development state prior to Supabase persistence hardening.
